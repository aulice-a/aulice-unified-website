The cost is far less than the damage of a negative review or lost loyalty." },

Immediate, private correction and mandatory training are the correct steps." },

        { text: "Apologize and offer to replace the dish with a different menu item.", score: 25, outcome: "Simply replacing the dish without verifying its safety or checking on the guest's health is dangerously negligent." },

A proactive, generous upgrade and personal touch are required to maintain their loyalty." },
        { text: "Ask them to wait in the lounge with a complimentary drink while the room is prepared.", score: 75, outcome: "This is acceptable for a short delay, but for a VIP, an immediate alternative is preferred." },
        { text: "Explain the delay is due to an understaffed housekeeping team and offer a 10% discount on their stay.", score: 25, outcome: "Explaining the internal problem and offering a small discount is inadequate for a VIP who expects their specific request to be met." },
        { text: "Give them the room as-is and promise housekeeping will finish while they are at dinner.", score: 0, outcome: "Handing over an unclean or unprepared room to a VIP is a catastrophic service failure." }

        { text: "Publicly defend your hotel, stating your records show the room was clean and the staff is well-trained.", score: 0, outcome: "Arguing with a guest online is a public relations disaster and validates their negative experience." },
        { text: "Ignore the review, as it is factually incorrect and responding might draw more attention to it.", score: 50, outcome: "Ignoring negative reviews signals to future guests that you don't care about feedback." },
        { text: "Contact the guest privately to ask them to remove the review in exchange for a future discount.", score: 25, outcome: "Asking for a review removal is against most platform policies and appears dishonest." }

        { text: "Grant the late checkout and move the new arrival to a different room, even if it's in a less desirable location.", score: 75, outcome: "This solves the problem but may create a new issue with the arriving guest." },
        { text: "Explain that late checkouts are not possible due to a full house and offer a 10% discount on their next stay.", score: 50, outcome: "A discount is a poor substitute for the requested service and feels like a brush-off." },

Reporting it is a duty to the hotel and other guests." },
