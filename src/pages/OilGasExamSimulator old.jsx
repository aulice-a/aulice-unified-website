        { text: "Immediately shut in the well using the Blowout Preventer (BOP) stack and initiate the well control procedure (e.g., Drillers Method or Wait and Weight).", score: 125, outcome: "Immediate shut-in is the critical first response to contain an influx (kick) and prevent a blowout. Speed is essential to maintain control." },
        { text: "Increase the mud pump speed to push the influx back down the hole.", score: 0, outcome: "Increasing pump speed will only exacerbate the influx and increase the risk of a catastrophic blowout." },
        { text: "Call the well site supervisor to discuss the best approach before taking any action.", score: 50, outcome: "While supervision is required, the delay risks losing primary well control. Action must be immediate." },
        { text: "Reduce the drilling fluid weight (mud density) to decrease bottom hole pressure.", score: 25, outcome: "Reducing mud weight is the opposite of what's needed; you need to increase mud weight to control the high-pressure influx." }

        { text: "Immediately stop the worker, enforce a complete shutdown and LOTO of the energy source, and report the safety violation to the supervisor for investigation.", score: 125, outcome: "LOTO is non-negotiable. Any violation creates an immediate, severe hazard of unexpected startup or energy release, requiring immediate cessation of work and reporting." },
        { text: "Allow the worker to quickly perform the task, but monitor them closely.", score: 0, outcome: "This validates the violation and exposes the worker and others to severe risk." },
        { text: "Install a temporary tag without a lock to cover the immediate work.", score: 25, outcome: "The lock is the essential physical barrier; a tag alone is insufficient and violates the procedure." },
        { text: "Ignore it since it is a minor procedural step and not a major mechanical issue.", score: 50, outcome: "LOTO is a major procedural requirement designed to prevent fatal incidents; it is never minor." }

Immediate donning of breathing apparatus and evacuation is the only acceptable response, regardless of initial monitor reading." },
        { text: "Assume the smell is from another source and wait for your monitor to reach the action level before responding.", score: 0, outcome: "H2S is often lethal before the high alarm threshold is reached, and the sense of smell is rapidly lost (olfactory fatigue)." },
        { text: "Proceed cautiously to inspect the manifold to confirm the source of the leak.", score: 50, outcome: "Entering a potentially high concentration area without SCBA risks immediate incapacitation and death." },
        { text: "Warn nearby colleagues verbally before attempting to find the nearest SCBA.", score: 75, outcome: "Warning colleagues is crucial, but personal protection (SCBA) is the first priority before attempting rescue or investigation." }

        { text: "Stop the handover, refuse to accept the incomplete sign-off, and insist the detailed checklist is performed by the outgoing or incoming team before taking responsibility.", score: 125, outcome: "Handover is a critical safety barrier. Accepting a fraudulent sign-off compromises process integrity and transfers unaccountable risk to the incoming team. Full compliance is mandatory." },
        { text: "Accept the sign-off but plan to re-do the checks yourself two hours into your shift.", score: 50, outcome: "Accepting the sign-off validates the procedural violation, and a two-hour delay leaves the process unverified during a critical transition." },
        { text: "Report the operator's fatigue and dishonesty to management after the shift is over.", score: 75, outcome: "The immediate danger is the unchecked equipment; the priority is resolving the procedural gap, then dealing with the operator's conduct." },
        { text: "Tell the operator to go home and worry about the checklist later.", score: 25, outcome: "While the operator should rest, the checklist must be completed before accepting control." }

A falling tool from that height is a potential fatality. Prevention and warning take priority over reporting." },
        { text: "Immediately fill out the 'Dropped Object' incident report and check the security of your lanyard.", score: 50, outcome: "Reporting is important, but the immediate safety of others below is the first concern." },
        { text: "Look over the edge to see where the wrench landed before doing anything else.", score: 0, outcome: "Yelling the warning must happen instantly; looking wastes critical time and may put your head into an unsafe position." },
        { text: "Assume the area below was clear since you didn't hear anyone scream.", score: 25, outcome: "A fatality can occur silently. Warning is mandatory regardless of perceived clearance." }

      options: [
        { text: "Initiate the emergency shutdown (ESD) sequence for the affected unit immediately to isolate the high-pressure source and manage the vessel inventory.", score: 125, outcome: "Isolation via ESD is the primary defense against overpressure/over-temperature, ensuring that no more inventory is added to the failing vessel or header." },
        { text: "Monitor the pressure gauge and wait for the relief valve to open to vent the pressure safely.", score: 75, outcome: "Waiting for the PRV is a passive response. Active intervention (ESD) to eliminate the source of the pressure is safer and preferred to prevent PRV chatter or failure." },
        { text: "Use the site PA system to tell all personnel in the unit to evacuate due to a potential explosion.", score: 50, outcome: "Unnecessary panic. Personnel should be informed of the emergency but focus should be on controlling the process, which eliminates the explosion risk." },
        { text: "Call the power company to ask when power will be restored.", score: 25, outcome: "Irrelevant to the immediate safety threat. Process control is the only priority." }

      options: [
        { text: "Immediately secure the leak source if possible, deploy spill containment measures (booms/skimmers), report the release to the control room, and commence environmental cleanup protocol.", score: 125, outcome: "All spills require immediate source control, containment, and reporting to mitigate environmental damage and comply with regulations." },
        { text: "Ignore the leak since it is minor and will be diluted quickly by the ocean.", score: 0, outcome: "All oil spills, regardless of size, are mandatory reportable environmental incidents." },
        { text: "Take photos of the spill for documentation before attempting to secure the source.", score: 50, outcome: "Documentation is secondary to immediate containment and mitigation." },
        { text: "Use a water hose to wash the oil into the sea, dispersing it so it is less visible.", score: 25, outcome: "This constitutes using unapproved dispersants and is illegal in most jurisdictions." }

        { text: "Stop the hot work immediately. Re-purge the vessel until the oxygen concentration is well within the acceptable safety limits (usually below 20.9%) and re-test, ensuring the area is isolated.", score: 125, outcome: "A high oxygen concentration significantly increases the risk of fire/explosion during welding. Work must stop, and conditions must be brought to specified safe limits." },
        { text: "Proceed with the hot work since the oxygen level is only 'slightly' above the limit.", score: 0, outcome: "Never compromise on gas testing limits; exceeding limits on oxygen or flammable gas is a critical violation." },
        { text: "Switch the planned hot work to cold work (e.g., grinding) to avoid the ignition risk.", score: 75, outcome: "While safer, grinding can still produce sparks or heat, and the vessel must still be confirmed inert before any work." },
        { text: "Ask the welder to move further away from the vessel to prevent ignition.", score: 25, outcome: "The hazard is inside the vessel/atmosphere; physical distance from the work area does not negate the explosion risk." }

If below limits, instruct the pilot to hold or divert to an alternate site, overriding the supervisor's scheduling demand.", score: 125, outcome: "Safety overrides schedule. The helideck supervisor's job is to ensure minimum operating criteria are met; if they are not, the flight must be stopped or diverted." },
        { text: "Pressure the pilot to attempt the landing, citing the urgent need for supplies.", score: 0, outcome: "Pressuring flight crew to violate safety limits is a severe regulatory and ethical breach." },
        { text: "Ask the pilot to descend slowly and manually attempt the landing below the standard limits.", score: 50, outcome: "Manual landing under low visibility is high risk. Standard operating limits are established for safety." },
        { text: "Temporarily turn off some non-critical lights on the platform to improve the pilot's night vision.", score: 75, outcome: "Lighting is standardized. While well-intentioned, reducing mandatory lighting may confuse the pilot and does not resolve the turbulence/visibility issue." }

Immediate non-entry rescue is required to prevent the attendant from becoming a second victim." },
        { text: "The stand-by person immediately enters the tank to assist the technician, as time is critical.", score: 0, outcome: "Entering the tank without proper equipment or relief will lead to two casualties due to the same hazardous atmosphere." },
