Speed is essential to maintain control." },

        { text: "Call the well site supervisor to discuss the best approach before taking any action.", score: 50, outcome: "While supervision is required, the delay risks losing primary well control. Action must be immediate." },
        { text: "Reduce the drilling fluid weight (mud density) to decrease bottom hole pressure.", score: 25, outcome: "Reducing mud weight is the opposite of what's needed; you need to increase mud weight to control the high-pressure influx." }

Immediate donning of breathing apparatus and evacuation is the only acceptable response, regardless of initial monitor reading." },

Accepting a fraudulent sign-off compromises process integrity and transfers unaccountable risk to the incoming team. Full compliance is mandatory." },

A falling tool from that height is a potential fatality. Prevention and warning take priority over reporting." },

Re-purge the vessel until the oxygen concentration is well within the acceptable safety limits (usually below 20.9%) and re-test, ensuring the area is isolated.", score: 125, outcome: "A high oxygen concentration significantly increases the risk of fire/explosion during welding.
