  situations: [
    { id: 1, scenario: "A long-standing, high-net-worth client with a history of sporadic, large cash deposits attempts to deposit $15,000 in cash, stating it's for a 'personal debt repayment.' This exceeds the Cash Transaction Report (CTR) threshold.", options: [ { text: "Complete the transaction and immediately file a mandatory Currency Transaction Report (CTR) with FinCEN.", score: 125, outcome: "This is the correct regulatory action. Transactions over $10,000 must be reported regardless of the client's relationship, adhering to BSA/AML compliance." }, { text: "Refuse the deposit and ask the client to return with a wire transfer instead.", score: 50, outcome: "Refusing the deposit is unnecessary and impacts client relations. The focus should be on compliance, not avoidance." }, { text: "Process the deposit without filing a report, based on the client's reliable history.", score: 0, outcome: "Failing to file a CTR is a severe violation of banking regulations (BSA) and compliance protocols." }, { text: "Suggest the client deposit $8,000 today and $7,000 tomorrow to avoid the reporting requirement.", score: 25, outcome: "This constitutes 'structuring,' a felony under money laundering laws. Facilitating structuring is a serious compliance failure." } ] },
    { id: 2, scenario: "A corporate client is requesting a large, complex loan. During due diligence, you find discrepancies in their financial statements that suggest aggressive accounting, but their overall financial health is solid.", options: [ { text: "Document the discrepancies, discuss them with the Credit Risk team, and require clarification/amendments before proceeding.", score: 125, outcome: "Thorough risk assessment and transparency are essential. Addressing red flags with the risk team and the client mitigates future losses and regulatory scrutiny." }, { text: "Ignore the minor discrepancies to secure the large, profitable deal quickly.", score: 0, outcome: "This sacrifices the bank's integrity and long-term risk profile for short-term gain, leading to potential future write-downs and regulatory fines." }, { text: "Approve the loan quickly, but charge a higher interest rate to cover the perceived risk.", score: 75, outcome: "While charging a premium for risk is standard, failing to clarify the statements exposes the bank to unnecessary, hidden risk." }, { text: "Refer the client to a competitor to avoid dealing with the complex accounting.", score: 25, outcome: "Turning away a potentially viable client due to complexity is poor business development and fails the client's needs." } ] },
    { id: 3, scenario: "You receive an urgent subpoena for client financial records. The subpoena appears valid but requests highly sensitive, non-public personal information for multiple unrelated accounts.", options: [ { text: "Verify the subpoena‚Äôs authenticity and scope with the Legal and Compliance departments before releasing any documents.", score: 100, outcome: "Releasing client information must adhere to strict internal protocols and legal review to protect client privacy and the bank from liability." }, { text: "Immediately release the documents as requested to comply with the court order and avoid penalties.", score: 50, outcome: "Releasing documents without internal review risks violating privacy laws (like Gramm-Leach-Bliley) if the scope is overly broad or the subpoena is flawed." }, { text: "Contact the clients whose records are requested to inform them of the subpoena and ask how they wish to proceed.", score: 75, outcome: "While transparency is good, legal advice often dictates that you should not notify clients until after the bank's legal team has reviewed the mandatory disclosure." }, { text: "Refuse to comply, citing client confidentiality, and risk contempt of court.", score: 0, outcome: "A valid subpoena overrides client confidentiality; refusal without legal grounds is a major compliance failure." } ] },
    { id: 4, scenario: "You are preparing a pitch for a major institutional investor. Your supervisor gives you internal, non-public research from a different department that strongly supports your investment thesis.", options: [ { text: "Review the research with the Compliance team to ensure it's permissible for external disclosure before including it in the pitch.", score: 125, outcome: "Using internal research without compliance clearance risks leaking Material Non-Public Information (MNPI), which could lead to insider trading accusations and regulatory action." }, { text: "Include the research immediately, as it greatly strengthens the pitch and helps the bank win the deal.", score: 0, outcome: "This is a direct violation of information barriers ('Chinese Walls') and creates regulatory risk." }, { text: "Only use the research to inform your argument but don't cite the internal document itself.", score: 50, outcome: "While better, the research might still contain MNPI that influences the client, making this a gray area that should be avoided." }, { text: "Exclude the research entirely and base the pitch only on publicly available data.", score: 75, outcome: "This is the safest option, but you may lose a competitive edge. Full compliance review is the optimal path." } ] },
    { id: 5, scenario: "A junior colleague notices an anomaly in a trading algorithm‚Äîa temporary inefficiency that, if exploited manually, could yield a personal profit of $50,000 before the system patch.", options: [ { text: "Immediately report the loophole to the Technology and Compliance teams to have the algorithm fixed and ensure no one else exploits it.", score: 125, outcome: "Reporting the flaw protects the bank's system integrity, prevents market manipulation, and is the highest standard of ethical conduct." }, { text: "Exploit the loophole once for $50,000, then immediately report it.", score: 0, outcome: "Unauthorized trading using non-public information about a system flaw is unethical and illegal, often resulting in termination and regulatory fines." }, { text: "Tell the colleague to ignore it, as exploiting it might lead to trouble.", score: 25, outcome: "Ignoring a known flaw is negligent and exposes the bank to massive risk if another employee or external entity finds it." }, { text: "Discuss the potential profit with a senior colleague to see if they think it's worth the risk.", score: 50, outcome: "This spreads the knowledge of the flaw without addressing the core problem: the need for a system fix." } ] },
    { id: 6, scenario: "You are analyzing a client's portfolio performance when you notice a large, suspicious fund transfer to an offshore account in a high-risk jurisdiction, flagged internally as potential money laundering.", options: [ { text: "Follow the bank's Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedure, freeze the funds if necessary, and immediately file a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).", score: 125, outcome: "Compliance with AML/KYC regulations is paramount. SAR filing is legally required when suspicion is present, and immediate action prevents further illicit activity." }, { text: "Contact the client and ask them for a detailed explanation for the transfer.", score: 25, outcome: "Notifying the client of an SAR (known as 'tipping off') is illegal and hinders the investigation. You must proceed internally first." }, { text: "Ignore the flag, as the client is very important and you do not want to jeopardize the relationship.", score: 0, outcome: "Prioritizing client relationship over AML compliance is a severe violation that can lead to catastrophic fines and criminal liability for the bank." }, { text: "Wait a few weeks to see if similar suspicious activity occurs before filing the report.", score: 50, outcome: "Delaying an SAR compromises the investigation and the bank's duty to report suspicious activity promptly." } ] },
    { id: 7, scenario: "Your team is under immense pressure to meet quarterly sales targets. Your manager suggests offering highly complex, high-fee structured products to less sophisticated clients who might not fully understand the risk.", options: [ { text: "Express concern to your manager, citing **Suitability** requirements, and escalate the sales practice to Compliance if the practice continues.", score: 125, outcome: "The duty of suitability requires that products sold match the client's financial sophistication, objectives, and risk tolerance. Escalation protects both the client and the bank's reputation." }, { text: "Follow the manager's direction, as meeting targets is the priority and the clients signed a waiver.", score: 0, outcome: "Waivers do not absolve the bank of suitability duty, and selling unsuitable products is often predatory and leads to regulatory action (e.g., FINRA)." }, { text: "Only offer the products to clients who ask about high-risk investments.", score: 75, outcome: "While better, you still have an affirmative duty to ensure the product is suitable, even if the client expresses interest." }, { text: "Sell the products, but verbally warn the clients about the high risk.", score: 50, outcome: "A verbal warning is insufficient; documented suitability and full disclosure of complexity are required." } ] },
    { id: 8, scenario: "A private equity client asks for your bank to finance a leveraged buyout (LBO) of a competitor. You know the LBO will result in massive job losses in a local community where your bank has significant retail presence.", options: [ { text: "Provide the financing if the deal meets all regulatory and credit risk criteria, separating business decisions from social impact.", score: 100, outcome: "While social responsibility is a factor, a bank's primary fiduciary and credit duty is to its shareholders and maintaining prudential lending standards. Blocking a profitable, compliant deal based purely on social risk is difficult to justify." }, { text: "Refuse the financing to protect the bank's public reputation and the local community.", score: 50, outcome: "This is a decision based on social responsibility, which is important, but it neglects the bank's core function and its fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder return when all risk parameters are met." }, { text: "Insist on a lower leverage ratio to minimize the risk of post-LBO default, regardless of social impact.", score: 75, outcome: "Focusing on credit risk is always correct, but it sidesteps the ethical/social question." }, { text: "Anonymously inform the press about the LBO's negative community impact before the deal closes.", score: 0, outcome: "Leaking client deal information is a severe breach of confidentiality and trust." } ] },
    { id: 9, scenario: "You are the manager of a small branch. A long-time employee is consistently underperforming, but they are a single parent and firing them would cause severe hardship. You need to staff a new, critical compliance role.", options: [ { text: "Reassign the employee to a non-critical administrative role that matches their current performance level, then hire a qualified candidate for the compliance position.", score: 125, outcome: "This balances the needs of the business (hiring a competent compliance officer) with compassion for the employee, showing ethical management." }, { text: "Fire the employee immediately and hire a new person for the compliance role.", score: 50, outcome: "While efficiency is restored, this ignores the duty of care to employees and should be a last resort after performance management." }, { text: "Place the underperforming employee in the critical compliance role, hoping they improve.", score: 0, outcome: "Placing an underperforming employee in a critical compliance role is negligent and exposes the bank to massive regulatory risk." }, { text: "Keep the employee in their current role and simply outsource the new compliance function to a high-cost consultant.", score: 25, outcome: "This is fiscally irresponsible and avoids the core HR management issue." } ] },
    { id: 10, scenario: "You discover a pattern of gender-biased pay disparity among senior staff, which is not illegal but is against the bank‚Äôs stated corporate values of equity.", options: [ { text: "Privately present the data and a proposal for a phased correction to the head of HR and the executive management team.", score: 100, outcome: "Addressing ethical disparities through formal channels is the most effective way to uphold corporate values without violating privacy or causing internal chaos." }, { text: "Confront the executives responsible publicly during the next town hall meeting.", score: 25, outcome: "Public confrontation is unprofessional and likely to result in retaliation without solving the underlying issue." }, { text: "Ignore the disparity, stating that if it were illegal, HR would have already addressed it.", score: 0, outcome: "Ignoring clear evidence of unfairness violates the bank's stated values and your professional ethical obligation." }, { text: "Leak the anonymous pay data to the entire company via an internal email.", score: 50, outcome: "While high impact, leaking data violates confidentiality and makes you vulnerable to termination for inappropriate communication." } ] }
