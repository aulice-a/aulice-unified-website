Referral and gentle, calming treatments are the professional standard." },
        { text: "Proceed with the extractions only after applying a strong desincrustation fluid to soften the skin.", score: 25, outcome: "Desincrustation helps, but the underlying issue is the inflammation and risk of permanent damage from manual pressure." },
        { text: "Perform a light microdermabrasion to prepare the skin for easier extractions.", score: 0, outcome: "Microdermabrasion over inflamed acne is a severe contraindication that can spread infection and cause trauma." },

Explain that the medication causes severe skin thinning, and a peel would result in severe burns, delayed healing, and likely scarring.", score: 125, outcome: "Oral retinoids (like Accutane) are an absolute contraindication for medium-depth chemical peels, waxing, and micro-needling. Wait 6-12 months post-cessation." },
        { text: "Apply a lower-concentration peel but monitor the client closely for reactions.", score: 0, outcome: "Any peel during isotretinoin use is extremely dangerous due to compromised healing." },

It must go through the full sterilization process (cleaning, disinfection, sterilization) before reuse." },

        { text: "Tell them it's fine as long as they apply a high-SPF sunscreen every hour.", score: 25, outcome: "While sunscreen is mandatory, even with it, direct sun exposure is too risky for compromised skin." },
        { text: "Suggest they stay in the shade until the redness subsides, then they can sit in the sun.", score: 75, outcome: "Getting out of the sun is the correct priority, but the warning should be stricter‚Äîno direct exposure." },

        { text: "Continue the massage, but use gloves and strictly avoid the area of the cold sore.", score: 50, outcome: "Even with gloves and avoidance, there is a high risk of spreading the virus to other areas of the face or the esthetician's hands/tools." },
        { text: "Apply a lot of antiseptic cream to the lesion and then proceed with the massage.", score: 25, outcome: "Antiseptic cream does not kill the virus or prevent spread from manipulation." },
        { text: "Suggest they wait until the sore is fully healed, but finish the service today using only masks and cleansers.", score: 75, outcome: "Finishing with low-touch elements is better than massage, but canceling entirely is the safest protocol." }

Inform the client that waxing trauma could rupture the delicate vessel walls and suggest an alternative method or avoidance for those areas.", score: 125, outcome: "Varicose veins are a contraindication for waxing due to the risk of bruising, hematoma, or vessel rupture from the trauma of the strip removal." },
        { text: "Apply the wax but pull the strips off very slowly and gently.", score: 50, outcome: "The trauma of removal, even gentle, is still too much risk for compromised veins." },
        { text: "Wax the area quickly and apply firm pressure immediately after removal to mitigate bruising.", score: 0, outcome: "Proceeding with the service in a contraindication zone is dangerous." },
        { text: "Suggest the client consult a doctor about their veins before they reschedule any future waxing.", score: 75, outcome: "This is a good referral, but the immediate action is refusing to wax the affected zone." }

Inform the client that a mandatory patch test must be performed 24-48 hours in advance to check for sensitivity and allergic reaction, and reschedule the peel.", score: 125, outcome: "Any high-concentration or high-risk chemical product requires mandatory patch testing to prevent severe reactions, especially on a new client." },
        { text: "Proceed with the peel since the client stated they've had peels before at a different spa.", score: 0, outcome: "Their history with other products/concentrations is irrelevant to the reaction to *your* specific product." },
        { text: "Apply a small amount to the jawline right now, wait 5 minutes, and if there is no reaction, proceed with the full peel.", score: 75, outcome: "This is a patch test, but a true test requires 24-48 hours to fully rule out delayed hypersensitivity reactions." },

Apply a calming, neutral product (like aloe or cool water) and monitor the client closely for signs of anaphylaxis or blistering.", score: 125, outcome: "Any adverse reaction requires immediate cessation of the product, soothing the area, and continued monitoring for life-threatening symptoms." },
        { text: "Apply a neutralizing solution on top of the mask and wait a few minutes for the pain to subside.", score: 50, outcome: "Applying a neutralizer is correct for a chemical peel, but for a mask/enzyme, immediate, complete physical removal is required first." },
        { text: "Tell the client that 'some stinging is normal' and let the mask remain for the full duration.", score: 0, outcome: "Extreme pain/swelling is *never* normal and indicates a severe adverse reaction." },

They must be safely disposed of and replaced with the correct, measured concentration." },
        { text: "Add the necessary amount of water to the jar to dilute the concentrate and bring it up to the correct level.", score: 75, outcome: "While this fixes the dilution, measuring the *exact* final concentration is impossible and leaves the solution risky for tools/skin." },
        { text: "Leave the jar as is, assuming a stronger solution will clean the tools better and faster.", score: 0, outcome: "Incorrectly concentrated disinfectants can be corrosive, dangerous, or less effective than the manufacturer's directions." },

Recommend a lightweight, hydrating serum or gel moisturizer instead, explaining that the rich cream will likely clog their pores.", score: 125, outcome: "Professional ethics requires recommending products appropriate to the client's current skin condition, prioritizing skin health over an expensive, inappropriate sale." },
