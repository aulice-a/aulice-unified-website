        { text: "Immediately stop picking of Product X, launch a root cause analysis, and audit transaction history (putaway, picking, adjustments) before correcting the WMS count.", score: 125, outcome: "Inventory accuracy is vital. Correcting the WMS without investigation only masks the process flaw causing the shrink. Root cause analysis is mandatory." },
        { text: "Update the WMS to 450 units and continue operations to avoid delaying orders.", score: 0, outcome: "This is a form of inventory negligence; the loss reason must be identified before correcting the book entry." },
        { text: "Assume the 50 missing units were picked but not scanned and focus the search on the shipping dock.", score: 75, outcome: "A reasonable assumption, but a full process audit is required to confirm the gap." },

        { text: "Wait 48 hours for the situation to resolve, assuming the government will intervene.", score: 0, outcome: "Supply chains cannot afford a 48-hour delay in a major crisis; proactive action is required immediately." },
        { text: "Air freight all remaining shipments from the origin country to your facility.", score: 50, outcome: "Air freight is extremely expensive and only viable for high-value/low-volume goods; a diversion is more cost-effective for containers." },

Stopping the operation and mandating correction is the priority." },

The full, correct code must be provided instantly to the broker to resolve the customs hold." },
        { text: "Assume the customs agent will look up the correct code and wait for the shipment to clear.", score: 0, outcome: "It is the shipper's responsibility to provide accurate documentation, and the shipment will remain on hold or be penalized." },
        { text: "Call the customer and ask them to pay an extra fee to expedite the customs review.", score: 25, outcome: "The delay is due to a shipper error, not a lack of payment." },

        { text: "Immediately **quarantine** the entire batch upon arrival. Flag the shipment as compromised and prevent distribution until Quality Assurance (QA) verifies product integrity and degradation risk.", score: 125, outcome: "Temperature breaches require immediate quarantine. Distributing compromised pharmaceuticals creates a severe quality and public health risk." },
        { text: "Place the products immediately into the cold room to rapidly cool them back down to temperature.", score: 50, outcome: "Cooling them is required, but the product is already compromised; QA must determine if the breach rendered them unusable." },
        { text: "Trust the supplier's manifest that the product is safe and allow it to be put away and sold.", score: 0, outcome: "Ignoring data logger evidence in cold chain logistics is a catastrophic quality violation." },

        { text: "Increase your standing order quantity by $10\\%$ to build safety stock, hoping to cover the delays.", score: 75, outcome: "Building safety stock helps *mitigate* the pain but does not *fix* the root problem of the unreliable supplier." },
        { text: "Switch suppliers immediately to the first alternative you can find, regardless of cost.", score: 50, outcome: "Immediate switching is risky; due diligence is needed, but the primary supplier must be held accountable first." },

      options: [
        { text: "Implement a 'right-sizing' strategy: use box sizes that match product dimensions and replace plastic void fill with paper-based protective dunnage for sustainability and efficiency.", score: 125, outcome: "Right-sizing reduces materials cost, dim weight, and labor time. Sustainable packaging also meets growing regulatory/customer demands." },
        { text: "Hire more packaging staff to work faster and ensure the void fill is packed more tightly.", score: 25, outcome: "Increasing labor to manage poor material choices is inefficient and expensive." },
        { text: "Switch from plastic bubble wrap to a cheaper form of plastic void fill (e.g., plastic peanuts).", score: 50, outcome: "This solves cost slightly but fails to address the volume, space, and sustainability issues." },
        { text: "Ask the team to use less void fill, even if the products shift inside the box.", score: 0, outcome: "Reducing dunnage at the expense of product protection increases damage rates." }

        { text: "Immediately enforce a security protocol: move high-value staging to a locked, secured cage or under 24/7 CCTV surveillance, and implement a dual-person custody check (signature required) during handover.", score: 125, outcome: "Security is a top priority for high-value goods. Reducing opportunity (locking, cameras) and enforcing accountability (custody check) minimizes theft risk." },
        { text: "Install a motion-activated floodlight in the dock area to deter theft.", score: 75, outcome: "Good for deterrence, but it does not prevent a determined thief and lacks accountability." },
        { text: "Ask the security guard to walk the dock area every hour during the night shift.", score: 50, outcome: "Intermittent checks are inadequate for high-value items, as theft can occur quickly between rounds." },
        { text: "Change the door code for the dock area and inform only authorized employees.", score: 25, outcome: "This helps but fails to address the lack of visibility and physical security on the internal staging." }

        { text: "Invest in and implement dynamic route optimization software, integrate real-time traffic/geo-fencing data, and audit driver adherence to scheduled stops and idle time reduction goals.", score: 125, outcome: "Optimization software is the most effective tool to minimize mileage, fuel consumption, and labor hours in dense last-mile delivery operations." },
        { text: "Reduce the number of drivers and increase the delivery quotas for the remaining staff.", score: 0, outcome: "This will lead to burnout, missed delivery windows, and poor customer service." },
        { text: "Switch all delivery operations to a single, cheaper third-party courier without reviewing service level agreements.", score: 50, outcome: "Cost reduction is good, but without SLA review, quality of service often plummets." },
        { text: "Tell the drivers to park further away from the delivery point to ensure a better route adherence score.", score: 25, outcome: "This increases walking time and does not fix the underlying routing inefficiency." }

Re-entering untested product into forward stock creates a high risk of shipping damaged goods to new customers." },
        { text: "Only put the returns back into stock if the box looks visually undamaged.", score: 0, outcome: "The external box condition reveals nothing about internal product functionality or component damage." },
        { text: "Sell the returned products immediately to a liquidator at a discounted price to save testing costs.", score: 75, outcome: "Good for immediate capital recovery, but often sells functional items too cheaply, losing potential profit from refurbishment." },
